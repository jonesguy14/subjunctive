**Subjunctive** â€“ a *tile-based puzzle game* engine for Python 3

Note: Subjunctive's API is **not stable**. We are still in the early
development stages and things are likely to change a lot!

* * *

# Using it

Don't use it. The time has not yet arrived.

# Goals / design principles

Obviously the main goal is that it be *significantly* easier to
implement a game with Subjunctive than without. To accomplish that, here
are some general design principles:

*   Provide sane and useful defaults.
*   Make it easy to override defaults.
*   Let client code be as beautiful and succinct as possible.

And, as usual, [the Zen of Python] provides excellent guidance.

# Contributing

## Code guidelines

*   **Read [PEP 8].**

*   **Use UNIX-style line endings.** Make sure your editor saves files
    with UNIX line endings (or that Git is configured to fix line
    endings when you commit).

*   **Avoid trailing whitespace.** Make sure your editor is set
    up to highlight or automatically strip trailing whitespace.

## Getting started

So, you want to help out? It's pretty easy. Here are some steps:

## 1. Know some Python

If you already know some programming, the official [Python Tutorial]
will teach you the basics. Be sure to run the Python interpreter and try
out the examples as you read them!

## 2. Know some Git

The best way to learn Git is by using it, but you might want to refer to
the first couple of chapters of the [Pro Git] book as you learn.
